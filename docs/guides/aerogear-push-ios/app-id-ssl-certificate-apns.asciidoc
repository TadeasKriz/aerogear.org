Apple related setup

Before you are able to use Push Notifications on your iOS Application, a few steps are required. This section of the tutorial gives a quick overview of what is needed!

Certificate Signing Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First you need to submit a request for a new digital certificate, which is based on a public/private key. The Certificate itself is acting as the public key, and when you request it, a private key is added to your *KeyChain* tool. Now the actual CSR (Certificate Signing Request) is done using *KeyChain Access*: In there choose *Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority*:

Make sure that you have choosen to store the CSR _on file_, since you need it later to request an SSL certificate for the _Apple Push Network Service_. Going back to *KeyChain Access* you now see a new *private* key:

Apple App ID and SSL certificate for APNs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you have your CSR, go to the link:https://developer.apple.com/account/overview.action[Provisioning Portal] and log in there. Now click on the *Identifiers* link in order to create a new App ID (use the *PLUS* Icon on the right). In the formular give the *App ID* a _descriptive_ name, like *My first AeroGear Push App*. Double check that the *Push Notifications* checkbox is _selected_:

Later in the same page you are asked for an *Explicit App ID*, since the generic *Wildcard App ID* does not work with Push Notifications. In the _Bundle ID_ field enter *org.aerogear.PushTest*, because that is the ID of our app, that we are building in this tutorial. *NOTE:* The _Bundle ID_ has to match the one from the actual iOS app.

In the next screen confirm your new App ID, and double check that the _Push Notifications_ option is _enabled_, afterwards click the _Submit_ button! Now you are _Done_. In the next screen, click on on the newly create *App ID*:

Here click the _Settings_ button and create a _Development SSL Certificate_:

Inside of the next Dialog you are asked to upload the _Certificate Signing Request_ that we created earlier. Now perform an upload of the *CSR* and click the _Generate_ button:

Finishing the upload dialog, you are coming back to the overview of the *App ID*. Now you can download the *Development SSL Certificate* that Apple has created for you:

The file is being downloaded as _aps_developer_identity.cer_. Double click on it and it shows up in the *KeyChain Access* tool:

Now you have to export this certifcate/private key pair to the *.p12* (_Personal Information Exchange_):

When exporting the file, as your private key, you need to assing a passphrase for it. Later, when connecting to APNs, you need the exported file and the passphrase.

Provisioning Profile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, you need to create an link:../provisioning-profiles[Apple Provisioning Profile]
